# PhillyTrails App

This is a React Front-End for [PhillyTrails](https://www.phillytrails.com).

The App is a [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) map (I used [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)) with some other functionality layered on top.

The [server](https://github.com/brandonfcohen1/phillytrails-server) is a simple Node/Express app which serves GeoJSON data from a [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) database. 

Please feel free to [get in touch](mailto:brandon.f.cohen@gmail.com) with any comments/questions/ideas. Also feel free to create issues and/or fork and make a PR.
