              During the early 2020 COVID-19 quarantine period, I started
              running more than I have since high school. Given how crowded the
              Schuylkill River Trail is through Center City, I started driving
              out to Fairmount Park and have ended up exploring different parts
              of the park almost every day.

              I realized that there aren't great trail maps of urban trails in
              Philadelphia. Some of the agencies which manage particular areas

              ), but weren't any great consolidated digital maps of the whole
              area. There is a lot of content on OpenStreetMap, but digesting
              that data isn't straightforward.

              As as side project, I decided to build this mapping platform from
              scratch with the features I think would be useful. I love maps,
              especially trail maps (of all kinds), and this has been a fun way
              to combine that with working on my software engineering skills.

              In Fall 2021 I re-wrote the app in React and moved the geospatial
              data hosting to PostGIS. The project is open source and can be
